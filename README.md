# BookGPT

Developed a simple Large Language Model (LLM)-based autonomous agent to assist users in finding book recommendations by genre. The agent successfully handles the following workflow: 
- when a user requests the top 100 books in a specific genre, the agent helps identify and present the top 10 books from that list. 
- The agent then helps the user select one book from these top 10 based on their preferences, and conclude the session with a thank you message. 

- The functionality is provided through a web application called "BookGPT," developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Flask is utilized as the framework to connect the frontend with the autonomous agent.

## Usage and Installation
- Clone this repository, then create a virtual environment using `venv` or `conda` and then to install the dependencies type `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal where the cloned repository resides after activating the virtual environment.
- Then run `app.py` by typing the command `python3 app.py` to launch the web application onto the local host.
- Feel free to use the `BookGPT` to your heart's desire.
